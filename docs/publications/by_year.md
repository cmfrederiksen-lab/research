    * **Summary:** This study found that teenagers with perinatally acquired HIV have higher rates of triple-class virological failure compared to young adults infected heterosexually. Predictors for failure included being aged 10-14 at ART start, African origin, and NNRTI-based initial regimens.

## 2016

* **De Luca A, Flandre P, Dunn D, et al. (2016). Improved darunavir genotypic mutation score predicting treatment response for patients infected with HIV-1 subtype B and non-subtype B receiving a salvage regimen. *J Antimicrob Chemother*. 2016 May;71(5):1352-60. doi: 10.1093/jac/dkv465.**

## 2015

* **Mocroft A, Lundgren J, Antinori A, et al. (2015). Late presentation for HIV care across Europe: update from the Collaboration of Observational HIV Epidemiological Research Europe (COHERE) study, 2010 to 2013. *Euro Surveill*. 2015;20(47). doi: 10.2807/1560-7917.ES.2015.20.47.30070.**
    * **Summary:** An update on late presentation (LP) for HIV care across Europe from 2010-2013, showing that LP remains a significant issue with nearly half of individuals presenting with a low CD4 count or an AIDS-defining event. The study calls for improved HIV testing strategies, especially for vulnerable groups.
* **Lodding IP, Sengeløv H, da Cunha-Bang C, et al. (2015). Clinical Application of Variation in Replication Kinetics During Episodes of Post-transplant Cytomegalovirus Infections. *EBioMedicine*. 2015 Jul;2(7):699-705. doi: 10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.05.003.**
    * **Summary:** This study re-evaluated the replication kinetics of CMV in transplant recipients, finding a median doubling time of 4.3 days, longer than previously reported. This suggests that screening intervals for pre-emptive therapy can be safely extended in cohorts with similar CMV doubling times.

## 2013

* **da Cunha-Bang C, Kirkby N, Sønderholm M, et al. (2013). The time course of development and impact from viral resistance against ganciclovir in cytomegalovirus infection. *Am J Transplant*. 2013 Feb;13(2):458-66. doi: 10.1111/ajt.12042.**
    * **Summary:** This study investigated the clinical impact of ganciclovir-related mutations (GRMs) in the CMV-UL97 gene. It proposed a categorization of GRMs and found that specific "Signature" GRMs were strongly associated with an excess risk of treatment failure.

## 2010
