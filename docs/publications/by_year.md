[cite_start]2015 Jul;2(7):699-705. doi: 10.1016/j.ebiom.2015.05.003**.
    * **Summary:** This study re-evaluated the replication kinetics of CMV in transplant recipients, finding a median doubling time of 4.3 days, longer than previously reported. This suggests that screening intervals for pre-emptive therapy can be safely extended in cohorts with similar CMV doubling times.

## 2013

* **da Cunha-Bang C, Kirkby N, Sønderholm M, Sørensen SS, Sengeløv H, Iversen M, Rasmussen A, Gustafsson F, Frederiksen CM, Kjaer J, Lepri AC, Lundgren JD.

    * [cite_start]**Summary:** This study investigated the clinical impact of ganciclovir-related mutations (GRMs) in the CMV-UL97 gene. [cite_start]It proposed a categorization of GRMs and found that "Signature" GRMs (sGRMs) were strongly associated with an excess risk of treatment failure, emerging after longer-term use of antiviral drugs.

## 2010

* **Larsen KH, Frederiksen CM, Burns JS, Abdallah BM, Kassem M. Identifying a molecular phenotype for bone marrow stromal cells with in vivo bone-forming capacity. *J Bone Miner Res*. [cite_start]2010 Apr;25(4):796-808. doi: 10.1359/jbmr.091018**.
    * **Summary:** Using DNA microarrays, this study identified a molecular signature predictive of the in vivo bone-forming capacity of human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Cells with bone-forming potential had an overrepresentation of extracellular matrix genes, while non-bone-forming cells expressed more immune-response genes.

## 2008

* **Frederiksen CM, Højlund K, Hansen L, Oakeley EJ, Hemmings B, Abdallah BM, Brusgaard K, Beck-Nielsen H, Gaster M. Transcriptional profiling of myotubes from patients with type 2 diabetes: no evidence for a primary defect in oxidative phosphorylation genes. *Diabetologia*. [cite_start]2008 Nov;51(11):2068-77. doi: 10.1007/s00125-008-1122-9**.
    * [cite_start]**Summary:** This study examined gene expression in myotubes from patients with type 2 diabetes and found no evidence for differential expression of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. [cite_start]The results support the hypothesis that impaired mitochondrial biogenesis is not a primary, inherent defect leading to insulin resistance.

## 2007

* **MacKenzie ED, Selak MA, Tennant DA, Payne LJ, Crosby S, Frederiksen CM, Watson DG, Gottlieb E. Cell-permeating alpha-ketoglutarate derivatives alleviate pseudohypoxia in succinate dehydrogenase-deficient cells. *Mol Cell Biol*. [cite_start]2007 May;27(9):3282-9. doi: 10.1128/MCB.01927-06**.
    * **Summary:** This research designed cell-permeating derivatives of alpha-ketoglutarate to counteract the "pseudohypoxia" induced by deficiencies in the TCA cycle enzymes SDH and FH. These derivatives successfully restored normal activity of HIFα prolyl hydroxylase, suggesting a new therapeutic strategy for cancers associated with TCA cycle dysfunction.

## 2003

    * [cite_start]**Summary:** This study evaluated the technical performance of cDNA microarrays with a limited number of spots, concluding they are of high technical quality. [cite_start]It demonstrated that procedures for producing the arrays are reproducible and that LOWESS normalization is suitable for minimizing variation, even with high local background levels.
* **Frederiksen CM, Knudsen S, Laurberg S, Ørntoft TF. Classification of Dukes' B and C colorectal cancers using expression arrays. *J Cancer Res Clin Oncol*. [cite_start]2003 May;129(5):263-71. doi: 10.1007/s00432-003-0434-x**.
    * **Summary:** The study used gene expression microarrays to classify colorectal tumors, demonstrating that it is possible to classify Dukes' B and C samples with less than 20% error. Gene clusters related to mitochondrial function, stromal remodeling, and cell adhesion showed discriminating differences between the stages.

## 2002

* **Birkenkamp-Demtroder K, Christensen LL, Olesen SH, Frederiksen CM, Laiho P, Aaltonen LA, Laurberg S, Sørensen FB, Hagemann R, Ørntoft TF. Gene expression in colorectal cancer. *Cancer Res*. [cite_start]2002 Aug 1;62(15):4352-63**.
    * [cite_start]**Summary:** Using oligonucleotide microarrays, this research identified 226 known genes and 157 ESTs highly relevant for colorectal cancer (CRC). [cite_start]Cluster analysis grouped normal tissue with Dukes' A, and Dukes' B with C, while Dukes' D clustered separately, providing potential new tumor markers and therapeutic targets.

## 2001

* **Thykjaer T, Workman C, Kruhøffer M, Demtröder K, Wolf H, Andersen LD, Frederiksen CM, Knudsen S, Orntoft TF. Identification of gene expression patterns in superficial and invasive human bladder cancer. *Cancer Res*. [cite_start]2001 Mar 15;61(6):2492-9**.
    * **Summary:** This study used oligonucleotide arrays to establish gene expression patterns for superficial and invasive bladder tumors. Hierarchical clustering correctly identified the tumor stage and revealed stage-characteristic gene clusters related to cell proliferation, adhesion, and proteinases, offering new biological insights.

## 1999

* **Frederiksen CM, Clausen J. The effects of oxidative stress in in vitro cultured astroglial cells. *Altern Lab Anim*. [cite_start]1999 May-Jun;27(3):351-7. doi: 10.1177/026119299902700307**.
    * [cite_start]**Summary:** This study showed that astroglial cells contain P450-reductase, which metabolizes paraquat, leading to the generation of free radicals and dose-dependent DNA fragmentation. [cite_start]The research also noted that DNA repair after exposure was slow, potentially due to the protracted generation of free radicals.
