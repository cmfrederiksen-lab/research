# Welcome to the Research Archive of Casper Møller Frederiksen, PhD

This site provides a comprehensive overview of the research contributions and publications by Casper Møller Frederiksen. His work focuses on the intersection of hematology, data science, and molecular biology, aiming to improve patient outcomes through data-driven insights.

## Overview of Research

[cite_start]Dr. Frederiksen's research portfolio is diverse, with a significant focus on **data-driven hematology**. [cite_start]His recent work involves creating large-scale data repositories for patients with lymphoid cancers to facilitate epidemiological, molecular, and data-driven research. [cite_start]This includes the application of **machine learning** and the development of medical artificial intelligence (mAI) to analyze complex datasets from nationwide registers and electronic health records.

His earlier work spans several domains, including:
* [cite_start]**Infectious Diseases:** Investigating virological responses to treatment in HIV patients, particularly focusing on co-infections and risk factors for treatment failure.
* [cite_start]**Molecular Biology:** Identifying molecular phenotypes for bone marrow stromal cells and exploring the genetic basis of cancers through transcriptional profiling.
* [cite_start]**Oxidative Stress:** Studying the effects of oxidative stress in astroglial cells.
