# Research Topics

Dr. Frederiksen's research bridges clinical medicine with data science and molecular biology. The primary focus areas are detailed below.

### Data-Driven Hematology and Medical AI

[cite_start]A central theme of the current research is the development of "data-driven hematology". This involves leveraging large, nationwide health datasets to advance the understanding and treatment of hematological cancers. [cite_start]The goal is to create a framework where meta-learning and medical artificial intelligence (mAI) can be applied to complex patient data, a field that has been limited by the lack of large, shared datasets. [cite_start]By creating open-source processing pipelines and a secure cloud-computing environment, this research aims to build tools that can be deployed directly into EHR systems, providing near real-time decision support for clinicians.

### Cancer Genomics and Molecular Classification

Early work focused on using microarray technology to understand the molecular basis of cancer. This involved large-scale gene expression profiling to:
* [cite_start]**Classify Tumors:** Differentiate between stages of colorectal and bladder cancer based on unique transcriptional signatures. [cite_start]This work demonstrated that molecular classification of common cancers was becoming a reality.
* [cite_start]**Identify Biomarkers:** Pinpoint new potential tumor markers and therapeutic targets by identifying genes that are consistently up- or down-regulated in tumor tissue compared to normal tissue. [cite_start]A key finding was the consistent down-regulation of 15 nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins in colorectal cancer.

### Infectious Disease Epidemiology in Vulnerable Populations

[cite_start]As a collaborator in large European cohorts like COHERE, Dr. Frederiksen contributed to major studies on HIV and other viral infections. This research has explored:
* [cite_start]**Treatment Response Disparities:** Investigating why immunological and virological responses to antiretroviral therapy differ between migrant and native populations in Europe.
* [cite_start]**Virological Failure:** Identifying risk factors for treatment failure in specific populations, such as teenagers with perinatally acquired HIV.
* [cite_start]**Viral Resistance:** Developing improved methods for predicting viral resistance to specific drugs, such as darunavir, and understanding the clinical impact of resistance mutations in CMV infections post-transplant.

### Cellular Stress and Metabolism

Research at the cellular level has investigated fundamental biological processes and their role in disease. This includes:
* [cite_start]**Metabolic Dysfunction in Disease:** Studying the link between TCA cycle dysfunction, "pseudohypoxia," and cancer, leading to the design of novel therapeutic compounds.
* [cite_start]**Primary Defects in Type 2 Diabetes:** Using transcriptional profiling to test the hypothesis that impaired mitochondrial biogenesis is a primary, inherited defect in type 2 diabetes, with findings suggesting it is not.
* [cite_start]**Oxidative Stress:** Examining how xenobiotics can induce oxidative stress and DNA damage in astroglial cells, providing insight into the cellular effects of free radicals.
