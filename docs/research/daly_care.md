# The DALY-CARE Project

### The Danish Lymphoid Cancer Research (DALY-CARE) Data Resource

The DALY-CARE project represents a foundational effort to establish a new paradigm of **data-driven hematology** in Denmark.

**Publication:** *The Danish Lymphoid Cancer Research (DALY-CARE) Data Resource: The Basis for Developing Data-Driven Hematology.*

#### **Aim and Background**

The primary aim of the DALY-CARE project is to create a large-scale, comprehensive data repository for all patients with lymphoid-lineage cancers (LC) in Denmark. Historically, research in medical artificial intelligence (mAI) has been hampered by a lack of access to large, shared datasets. The DALY-CARE resource was created to address this gap, enabling advanced research into cancers that share numerous epidemiological and clinical features, making them ideal for meta-learning approaches.

#### **Methods and Scale**

The project involved an extensive data gathering effort, using open-source pipelines to create a resource approved for epidemiological, molecular, and data-driven research. It successfully integrated data for all Danish adults registered with LC diagnoses since 2002, totaling **65,774 patients**.

The resource combines data from:
* 10 nationwide Danish registers
* Electronic Health Records (EHR)
* Nationwide laboratory data

This vast amount of information is hosted on a high-powered cloud-computer platform, creating a secure and powerful research environment.

#### **Data Contents**

The DALY-CARE resource is exceptionally rich, containing millions of data points across numerous domains, including:

* **Treatments:** 21,750 cytoreductive treatment plans, 21.3 million outpatient prescriptions, and 12.7 million in-hospital administrations.
* **Biochemistry:** 77.3 million biochemical analyses.
* **Diagnoses:** 14.8 million ICD-10 comorbidity codes.
* **Pathology:** 4.5 million pathology codes.
* **Procedures:** 8.3 million treatment procedures and 1.0 million surgical procedures.
* **Imaging:** 3.3 million radiological examinations.
* **Vitals:** 18.3 million vital sign values.
* **Outcomes:** Comprehensive survival data.

#### **Conclusion and Impact**

The DALY-CARE data resource is a transformative tool for hematological research. It enables a wide range of studies, from molecular analyses to real-world evidence evaluation of care efficacy.

Most importantly, it serves as the basis for developing and deploying **near real-time decision-support tools** and other mAI applications directly into clinical EHR systems. This allows for the extrapolation of clinical trial results to real-world practice, with the ultimate goal of improving care for patients with lymphoid cancers and streamlining health data infrastructure across medicine.
